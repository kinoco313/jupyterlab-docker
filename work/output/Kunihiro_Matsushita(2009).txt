Kidney function predicts cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, but little is known about the association of changes in estimated GFR (eGFR) with clinical outcomes. We investigated whether 3- and 9-yr changes in eGFR associated with risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) and all-cause mortality among 13,029 participants of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study. After adjustment for baseline covariates including eGFR in Cox proportional hazards models, the quartile of participants with the greatest annual decline (annual decline ≥5.65%) in eGFR were at significantly greater risk for CHD and all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 1.30 [95% confidence interval 1.11 to 1.52] and 1.22 [95% confidence interval 1.06 to 1.41], respectively) compared with the third quartile (annual decline between 0.33 and 0.47%). We observed similar results when we analyzed 9-yr changes in eGFR. Adjustment for covariates at the second eGFR used to estimate change reduced the association with CHD but not with mortality. Among participants with stage 3 chronic kidney disease, an increase in eGFR during the first 3 yr also associated with a higher risk for mortality, perhaps as a result of clinical instability. In conclusion, a steeper than average decline in eGFR associates with a higher risk for CHD and all-cause mortality. Increases in eGFR among participants with chronic kidney disease associate with similar increased risks.

During 16 to 18 yr of follow-up, there were 1627 cases of CHD and 2042 deaths before January 1, 2006. The overall incidence rates of CHD and all-cause mortality were 9.8 per 1000 person-years and 11.7 per 1000 person-years. The age-, race-, and gender-adjusted incidence rates of CHD and all-cause mortality were calculated among the quartiles of percentage annual change of eGFR (Figure 2). Despite the greater mean eGFR in Q1, this group had the greatest incidence rate of CHD and all-cause mortality. As we hypothesized, Q4—consisting of individuals with minimal decrease or an increase in eGFR—showed a higher incidence rate of both outcomes compared with Q3.

We repeated our analyses adjusting for covariates at visit 2 and obtained a similar result for all-cause mortality (HR 1.28; 95% CI 1.11 to 1.47 in Q1), although the association of change in eGFR with incident CHD was attenuated (HR 1.13; 95% CI 0.96 to 1.31; P = 0.134). Similarly, Q1 was significantly associated with a higher risk for all-cause mortality but not with incident CHD in individuals with eGFR at visit 2 between 30 and 59 and between 60 and 89 (data not shown). In contrast, no associations were observed between change in eGFR and either outcome in the group with eGFR ≥90 at visit 2. In the participants with eGFR at visit 2 between 30 and 59, Q4—a group with minimal decrease or an increase in eGFR—was also associated with a higher risk for all-cause mortality (HR 7.16; 95% CI 1.63 to 31.36).

Interestingly, among individuals with current eGFR between 30 and 59, a past increase in eGFR over 3 yr was also associated with higher risk for all-cause mortality. This positive association was not entirely unexpected, because individuals with an increase in eGFR to 30 to 59 are likely to have had more severe impairment in kidney function in the past (mean eGFR at visit 1 48.7 in Q4 versus 56.1 ml/min per 1.73 m2 in the reference group). Otherwise, this increase may be related to instability of kidney function. An increase in eGFR might result from decreased serum creatinine as a result of muscle loss related to malnutrition or ill health. Mean triglyceride and LDL cholesterol concentrations and body mass index only slightly decreased or were unchanged from visit 1 to visit 2 for Q4 among participants with eGFR 30 to 59 ml/min per 1.73 m2 at visit 2 (triglycerides from 183 at visit 1 to 176 mg/dl at visit 2; LDL cholesterol from 148 to 138 mg/dl; and body mass index from 27.7 to 28.0); however, a contribution of muscle loss could not be eliminated, because we did not have direct measures of body composition. Nevertheless, the positive association of a past increase in eGFR with all-cause mortality suggests that once individuals have reached an eGFR of <60, it may be useful to track their kidney function even when a subsequent eGFR measurement is higher. Overall, our results suggest that changes in eGFR over time provide additional prognostic information to current eGFR.
